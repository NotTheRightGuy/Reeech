I've been in, so I've been in a lot of acquisition like deals and stuff and I learn a lot about finance people as well there like manipulation and due diligence and then changing the valuation like people change the valuation after so they a lot of people string you on to acquire you and then it takes like six months it's like six to 12 months they want to see everything they want to see the your stripe and your code and whatever and then in the end they'll change the price to lower because you're already invested. So it's like a negotiation tactic, right? And like no, I don't want to sell, right? And the problem with my companies is like they make... 90% profit margin. So the multiple. companies get sold with multiple kinds of multiples of profit or revenue. and often the multiple is like three times, three times or four times or five times, revenue or profit. So in my case. they're all automated so I might as well wait three years and I get the same money as when I sell and then I can still sell the same company. You know, I mean, I can still sell for three five times. So. financially it doesn't really make sense to sell. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Unless the price high enough, like if the price gets to like six or seven or eight, I don't want to wait six years for the money, you know? But if you give me three, like three years nothing, like, I can wait. So I mean, they're really valuable stuff about the companies you create is not just the interface and the crowdsourced content, but the people themselves, like the user base. Yeah, but nominalist, it's a community, yeah. Yeah. So no one So I could see that being extremely valuable. I'm surprised I had not. I'm surprised I have not. It's like my baby. It's like my first product that took off. I don't really know if I want to sell it. It's like something you will be nice when you're old that you're still working on this. It's like a, it has like a mission which is like people should travel anywhere, people should travel anywhere, and they can work from, from anywhere and they can meet different cultures and that's a good way to make the world get better. If you go to China, live in China, you'll learn that they're nice people and a lot of stuff you hear about China's probably gone, a lot of stuff is true as well, but it's more, you know, you learn a lot from traveling and I think that's why it's like a cool product to like not sell... I have less emotional feeling with AI projects like photo like photo I, which I could sell, yeah. something Yeah, the thing you also mentioned is you have to price in the fact that you're going to miss. Okay. Yeah, the company, for you. And the meaning it gives you, right? There's a very famous like depression after start upon a solar company. Like they're like, this was my, this was me, like, who am I? Yeah, the company. An immediate. and they immediately start building another one. You know, they can never get stopped. So.
