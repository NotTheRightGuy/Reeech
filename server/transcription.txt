 I spoke to Elon a few times recently about you, about Blue Origin, and he was very positive about you as a person and very supportive of all the efforts. You've been leading at Blue. What's your thoughts? You worked with a lot of leaders at Amazon at Blue. What's your thoughts about Elon as a human being and a leader? Well, I don't really know Elon very well. You know, his public persona. know you can't know anyone by their public persona. It's impossible. I mean you may think you do but I guarantee you don't. So I don't really know you know Elon way better than I do Lex but in terms of his judging by the results he must be a very capable leader. There's no way you could have you know Tesla and SpaceX without being a capable being a capable leader, it's impossible. Yeah, I just, I hope you guys hang out sometimes, shake hands and sort of, have a kind of friendship that would inspire just the entirety of humanity, because what you're doing is like one of the big grand challenges ahead for humanity. Well, I agree with you, and I think in a lot of these endeavors were very like-minded. saying we're identical but I think we're very like-minded and so I you know I love that idea.
